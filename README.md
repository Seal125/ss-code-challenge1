# Directions
Today we'll be doing a code challenge! For this code challenge, I want you to make sure you show your PEDAC process (make sure you write down your thoughts and general PEDAC explanations!), as though I were an interviewer! **You are allowed to use any language you prefer, but we will go through the solution in Python!** After you solve it, be sure to send up a pull request.

## Steps
1. Fork and clone this repo.
2. Create a new file, `exercises`, with the file extension of the language you plan to solve the challenge in.
3. Write down your PEDAC process!! Do this part first before you solve the challenge!
4. Solve challenge and send a pull request!


## Challenge
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:
* The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
* You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.

Example:
```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```
